# PURPOSE: Simple program that exits and returns a
#          status code back to the Linux kernel

# VARIABLES:
#          %eax holds the system call number
#          %ebx holds the return status

_start:
    movl $1, %eax   # this is the linux kernel command
                    # number (system call) for exiting
                    # a program
    movl $3, %ebx   # this is the status number we will
                    # return to the operating system.
                    # change this around and it will
                    # return different things to
                    # echo $?
    int  $0x80      # this wakes up the kernel to run
                    # the exit command
